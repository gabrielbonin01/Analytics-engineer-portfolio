<h1>Analytics Engineer Portfolio</h1>
<p>Here are the Analytics Engineer projects that I have completed for academics or self-learning. All my project are as much detail as it could and you can refer to the readme.md file as a reference</p>


<h3>Dbt project touching all feature</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gabrielbonin01/dbt-project">Dbt Project</a>: A project which I made by going through the documentation and learning how to use dbt technology. Also setting up a data warehouse with Snowflake and connecting it to dbt Cloud.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dimensional modelling with DBT</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gabrielbonin01/dbt-dimensional-modelling-project">DBT DL-Northwind dimensional modelling project</a>: In this analytics engineer project, i am working with the DL Northwind Sample Database. The project involves bringing the raw data into a data lake, then moving it to a staging layer and performing data cleansing. Next, creating new dimensions in order to finish the project with OBT analysis.</li>
</ul>
